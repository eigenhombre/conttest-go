![build](https://github.com/eigenhombre/conttest/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Continuous testing helper / file watcher, similar in design to 
[this Python version](https://github.com/eigenhombre/continuous-testing-helper),
rewritten in Go for ease of installation and performance.

# Install

Install Go using your OS'es package manager.  Then,

    go install github.com/eigenhombre/conttest@latest
    
# Usage

When `conttest` is run in a directory, its argument will be run once, then each time a file in that directory is saved.

## Examples

    # Simple command: no quotes needed:
    $ conttest ./build.sh

    # Add quotes to pass arguments to the target command...
    $ conttest "make -n"

    # ... or to run compound commands or pipes:
    $ conttest 'make && make install && myprog'
    $ conttest 'go test && say "OK" || say "FAIL"'
